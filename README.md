Circuit of Mana (for UGDK)
==========================

This is the repository for 3D prototypes of Circuit of Mana using Godot game
engine. Our goal is to have at least three prototypes with different point of
view: Third person; First person; and Fixed flying camera.

All prototypes can be found in "prototypes" directory. In "demos" directory
there are a couple of public mini-projects which have good examples of features
for the prototypes. Once all resources used in Godot projects should be imported
as scenes, the "assets" directory stores all source assets and each prototype
keeps its game assets (scenes) inside its own directory.

Requirements
------------

All you need is to have Godot (1.0devel)
